Tryin' to get on top
But it's never easy
Mastered my own luck
But it wasn't easy
I'm tryin' to feel alright
Around all these people
I try, but I'm just numb
This time

Deepest cut that I can't feel
Find my grip on the steering wheel
I know our pieces stuck
You can sit down if you don't mind me standin' up (Mind me standin' up)
I know I was too good to pass up (Too good to pass up)
Meeting you caused a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
I'd take the smallest crumb
But I'll never get back what I lost track of

Laugh when I'm still cryin'
Yeah, you know the deal
Burnt but it's still frying (Huh)
Yeah, you know the deal
Can't redeem my love
At such a steal
But you can't say I'm not tryin'
This time

Deepest cut that I can't feel
Find my grip on the steering wheel
I know our pieces stuck
You can sit down if you don't mind me standin' up (Mind me standin' up)
I know I was too good to pass up (Too good to pass up)
Meeting you caused a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
I'd take the smallest crumb
But I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of

I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track
